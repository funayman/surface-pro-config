files needed to set up a ballin surface pro 3

the files are used to triple boot Windows 10, [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), and [ArchLabs Linux](https://archlabslinux.com/) on a Surface Pro 3

The `INSTALL.md` has a rough guide documenting how the process was done. I've taken it and put together [a few blog posts](https://drt.sh/posts/surface-pro-3-triple-boot-01-windows/) with a more flushed description and some screen shots to help along the way.
